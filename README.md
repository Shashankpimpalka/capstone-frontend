## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Angular Signals: Master the new reactive primitive for fine-grained change detection, which significantly boosts performance.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Hydration: Learn how to optimize for Core Web Vitals using Angular's latest hydration features for near-instant page loads. 

3. Advanced Microservices & Resilience
Beyond Eureka and Gateway, 2026 demands "Smart Modular Systems". 
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): Move beyond REST. Learn Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous, loosely coupled communication between services.


4. Professional DevOps & Observability
Companies in 2026 expect developers to "own the run". 
Kubernetes (K8s): Move from simple Docker to managing clusters, Helm charts, and service meshes like Istio.
Universal Observability: Instead of basic logs, implement structured logging and distributed tracing using the Elastic Stack, Prometheus, Grafana, and Zipkin.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform or Ansible to define your microservices infrastructure programmatically.
